This repository contains Terraform templates for OCI developed by Bitnami.

Bitnami Multi-Tier templates to improve the capacity of single VM applications. All Bitnami Multi-Tier stacks are production configured following the industry standards: you can move your deployments from development to production in an easy and a reliable way. Multi-Tier solutions are a perfect choice to ensure high availability and performance in medium/large size production environments.
